# PlugCowboy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-plug/plug_cowboy)

A Plug Adapter for the Erlang [Cowboy][cowboy] web server.

## Installation

You can use `plug_cowboy` in your project by adding the dependency:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:plug_cowboy, "~> 2.0"},
  ]
end
```
You can then start the adapter with:

```elixir
Plug.Cowboy.http MyPlug, []
```

## Supervised handlers

The `Plug.Cowboy` module can be started as part of a supervision tree like so:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp do
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html
  # for more information on OTP Applications
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    # List all child processes to be supervised
    children = [
      {Plug.Cowboy, scheme: :http, plug: MyApp, port: 4040}
    ]

    # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html
    # for other strategies and supported options
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```
